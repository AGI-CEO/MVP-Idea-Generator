# MVP-Idea-Generator

## MVP-Idea-Generator

This repository contains a simple frontend web application that generates MVP (Minimum Viable Product) ideas for junior software engineers.

### How it works

The web application contains a form that asks the user about their skill level, their interests/hobbies, and their dislikes. This information is used to generate 3 MVP ideas that are tailored to the user's requirements.

The generation of ideas is done through an API call to an existing AI logic. Once the request is returned, a new DOM (Document Object Model) element is created beneath the form, showcasing the 3 ideas.

### How to use

1. Fill in the form with your skill level, interests/hobbies, and dislikes.
2. Click the 'Generate' button.
3. Wait for the AI to generate 3 MVP ideas based on your input.
4. The ideas will be displayed beneath the form.
